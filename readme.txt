== Description ==

Primary features of HW Image Widget:

* Allow you to choose responsive or fixed behavior.
* Uses TinyMCE for rich text editing of the image text field.
* Allow you to create a custom widget HTML-template in the active theme to override the default layout.
* Default settings can be overridden using filter.

Use standard installation process for a plug-in:

1. Install HW Image Widget either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the way the widget is displayed? =

Yes, you can create a file named hwim-template.php in your active theme folder. If this file exists, the HW Image Widget will use that file to render the widget. You can copy the default template as base. It is located in plugins/hw-image-widget/html/front-end.php.

= Can I put the title below the image instead? =

Yes, first you need to create a custom HTML-template for the widget (see above). Then you can use the hwim_title filter to remove the default title placement.

add_filter( 'hwim_title', function( $title ) { return ''; } )

= Can I change the default settings of the widget? =

Yes, you can change the widget default settings by using the hwim_get_defaults filter. It takes a single parameter (array). Default values are:

'title' => '',
'text' => '',
'src' => '',
'display_size' => 'responsive',
'display_width' => '',
'display_height' => '',
'original_width' => '',
'original_height' => '',
'keep_aspect_ratio' => true,
'alt' => '',
'url' => '',
'target_option' => '',
'target_name' => ''
